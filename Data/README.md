**Data**

The original files for the Ames and Tox21 dataset can be found in [Original_Datasets](Original_Datasets). The Tox21 dataset was downloaded from [https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp](https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp) (last accessed 2021-05-25) and the Ames dataset (ISSSTY) from [https://www.iss.it/isstox](https://www.iss.it/isstox) (last accessed 2021-05-25).

The processed datasets (after joining, chemical standardization and agregation) can be found in [Processed_Datasets](Processed_Datasets).

The train and test splits (compound-based and assay-based) for the Ames and Tox21 dataset can be found in [Train_Test_Splits](Train_Test_Splits).

The hyperparameters used for all machine learning models can be found in [Hyperparameters](Hyperparameters). Note that the Feature Net models used the same hyperparameters as the respective single task models.
