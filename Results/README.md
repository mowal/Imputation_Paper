**Results**

Several scoring metrics for all models on both compound-based and assay-based splits can be found in [Scores](Scores). This folder also contains the results for the investigations on chemical similarity and data availability.

The folder [Predictions](Predictions) contains the predictions for indivudual compounds for the models on assay-based splits as required for the analysis on chemical similarity and data availability.

The files [info_metrics_Ames](info_metrics_Ames.csv) and [info_metrics_Tox21](info_metrics_Tox21.csv) contain the computed information theory metrics used in the analysis on pairwise Feature Net models.
